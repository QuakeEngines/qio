all credits for any TrueCombat content belong team terminator\grovesix studio
Although some content may be custom to TCE if the pk3 starts with tc_ in its name, then 
the files in that pk3 have been used in TCE before qio.

Any pk3 starting with dim_ has been made by DimStar for use in qio.
dim_textures_1.pk3 is a collection of low quality textures (most originally used in TCE\CQB)
some have came from unknown games some from google and some created by DimStar.

Hopefully, in time ALL content used in TC will be replaced with higher res textures and models
