Developer notes. Just anything odd, interesting etc out of the source goes in here.


V: Doom3 visportal brushes should have a single side with editor/visportal texture and remaining sides with common/nodraw. Otherwise, proc compiler is giving a warning.

V: It's good to turn off the physics simulation while looking for bottlenecks in Qio (g_runPhysics 0).

V: Both Radiant, Doom3 editor and Qio's Radiant fork are not running correctly for me on my dedicated high speed GPU - I have to use the integrated one.
